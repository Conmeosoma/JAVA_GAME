## 🔧 Development

### Building from Source

**Using Command Line:**

```bash
# Navigate to project root
cd JAVA_GAME

# Compile all Java files
javac -d bin -sourcepath src src/main/Main.java src/**/*.java

# Run the game
java -cp bin main.Main
```

**Create JAR file:**

```bash
# Create manifest file
echo "Main-Class: main.Main" > manifest.txt

# Create JAR
jar cfm JAVA_GAME.jar manifest.txt -C bin . -C res .

# Run JAR
java -jar JAVA_GAME.jar
```

**Using Maven (if configured):**

```bash
# Compile
mvn compile

# Run
mvn exec:java

# Package
mvn package
```

### Running Tests

Currently, this project uses manual testing. Future plans include:

```bash
# Unit tests (planned)
mvn test

# Integration tests (planned)
mvn verify
```

**Manual Testing Checklist:**

- [ ] Player movement in all 4 directions
- [ ] Collision with walls, water, trees
- [ ] Camera follows player correctly
- [ ] FPS stays at 60
- [ ] No crashes when picking up items
- [ ] Dialogue displays correctly
- [ ] Combat deals damage properly
- [ ] Save/Load works

### Debug Mode

Enable debug mode by pressing `F3` (planned) to see:

- FPS counter
- Player world position (X, Y)
- Collision hitboxes
- Tile coordinates
- Memory usage
